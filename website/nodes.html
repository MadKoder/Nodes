    <h1>Nodes : A functional reactive language</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Nodes is a generalist, multi-paradigm programming language </p>
      <h2>Major paradigms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Functional</li>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        A program in Nodes is made of ... nodes, and a node is, in the most generic form, like this:
      </p>
      <div class="imgContainer"> <img title="Node" alt="A node" src="svg/Node.png"> </div>
      <p>Inputs and Outputs are of two types :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Values/Behaviors/Properties/Data/Signal/Vars/Cells</li>
        <li>Events/Signals/Messages/Event streams</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This distinction follows the basic principles of functional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">reactive programming</a>, which as already be described in <a href="http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/">many</a> <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">articles</a>, and is used by <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/tree/master">many libraries</a> (look also at <a href="http://scalareactive.org/index">this</a> or <a href="http://rx.codeplex.com/">this</a>), and even has <a href="functional">languages</a> designed with this principle.
        A property cannot be plugged into an message input, and an message cannot be plugged into a property input.
        Property inputs and outputs of a node are simply called inputs and outputs, while message inputs and outputs are called slots and signal (this is the same naming as in the widely used library <a href="http://qt.digia.com/">Qt</a>).
      </p>
      <h3>Hello, world</h3>
      <p>This is the classic "Hello, world" program:</p>
      <div class="imgContainer"> <img src="svg/HelloWorld.png" alt="Hello, world"> </div>
      <h3>Properties</h3>
      <p>Properties are persistent, continues data. They can change over time. Properties are drawn with plain lines.
      An input property of a node must be linked to one and only one output property of another node.
      There can't be direct nor indirect circular dependencies between nodes with properties, except in the case of reccursive functions.
      <div class="imgContainer"> <img title="CyclicDependency" alt="Cyclic dependency" src="svg/CyclicDependency.png"> </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Messages</h3>
      <p>
      Messages are stream of discrete data, channels in which messages are send from a node to other nodes.
      An message slot can be connected to 0+ messages signals (output).
      Messages are drawn with dashed lines. 
      An message may be <em>synchronous</em> or <em>asynchronous</em>. When a node sends a synchronous message, it waits for all the receiving nodes for completion.
      When they have finished, it may continue its work, eventually completing its own job.
      When sending an asynchronous event, it <em>may not</em> wait for the completion of receiving nodes. This behaviour depends on the implementation, that can support more or less parallelism.
      In case of a simple mono-task program, all events will be treated as synchronous.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fundamentalClasses">Fundamental classes</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Store</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="Store class" src="svg/Store.png"> </div>
        <p> A store node convert events to values. It has an initial value, and when it receives an event, change its own value to the value of the message. 
        Mathematically, it could be viewed as a kind of integral. In fact, it's easy to define an integration function with this operator.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Change</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="Change class" src="svg/Change.png"> </div>
        <p>The inverse of <em>Store</em>, a <em>Change</em> sends signal each time its input
          propertie's value change. Mathematically, it can ve viewed as a derivation.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Sample</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="Sample class" src="svg/Sample.png"> </div>
        <p>A sample takes a property and an message as inputs, and sends an event with the value of the property each time it receives an event.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Event dispatch</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="If event class" src="svg/IfEvent.png"> </div>
        <p>The <code>event dispatch</code> class takes a boolan message as inputs, and when receiving an event,
         sends an event to the <em>then</em> or <em>else </em>event
          stream, depending on the value of the received event.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>While</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="While class" src="svg/While.png"> </div>
        <p>
          A <code>while</code> node sends events continuously upon receiving a start event, while its condition is true.
          <p><strong>Warning : the output event must be synchronous, or else the <code>while</code> node may take all processing power sending events without stopping.</strong></p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>For each</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="For each class" src="svg/ForEach.png"> </div>
        <p>
          When a <code>For each</code> node receives an event with a Sequence as value, it sends an event for each of the sequence's element. 
          The value of each sent event is the value of its corresponding element.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>Main types of nodes</h2>
      <p>Here are described the main categories of nodes.</p>
      <p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img title="Function" alt="Function class" src="svg/Function.png"> </div>
        <p>
          A function node has 1+ input value(s) and has exactly 1 output value. It doesn't
          have any side effect, i.e. for the same inputs, the exact same output is given.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="Action" src="svg/Action.png"> </div>
        <p>
          An action node has 1 slot, 0+ inputs, an 1+ signals. When receiving a message, it can send message to other nodes, potentially using value of inputs.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>External properties</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="External property" src="svg/ExternalProperty.png"> </div>
        <p>
          External properties enable the node program to communicate with the outside.
          Examples of input external properties are the mouse position, windowd size, or the program arguments.
          Examples of output external properties are a GUI or a scene graph.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>External messages</h3>
        <div class="imgContainer"> <img alt="External message" src="svg/ExternalMessage.png"> </div>
        <p>
          Like the external properties, external messages enable IO operations.
          Examples of input external messages are keyboard key events or mouse events.
          Examples of output external messages are console print or file write.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>Value types</h2>
      <p>
        Properties and message have values, that are typed. Here are the types defined for these values.
      </p>
      <h3>Int</h3>
      <h3>Float</h3>
      <h3>String</h3>
      <h3>Bool</h3>
      <h3>List</h3>
      <h3>Unit</h3>
      <p>This type can only be used with messages. It can have only one value, so has no real information.
      It's the equivalent of "void" in many language.</p>
      <h3>Structs</h3>
      <p>
        Structs are the main method to construct new types. A struct type defines a list of named fields with types.
        A struct can also have slots, signals and functions. A slot may be defined as mutator, in which case it can change the struct value.
        By default a slot is const (i.e. non mutator), it can only send messages through struct's signals.
        Slots and functions can be virtual. In this case, sub-classes must add the keyword <em>override</em> to override declarations.
        Virtual slots and functions can be declared without body. They are abstract. If a class has at least one abstract function, it is itself an abstract class.
        An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
      </p>
      <h4>Structural inheritance</h4>
      <p>
        Struct type can be defined in a hierarchy. A Struct type can have sub-classes, that have the same fields than their super-class.
        A struct instance can be used as input anywhere any of its super-classes are required.
        Examples :
        <p>
          Vec2 :
          <ul>
            <li>Float x</li>
            <li>Float y</li>
            <li>subs : 
              <ul>
                <li>Vec3 :
                <ul>
                  <li>Float z</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here a Vec3 has 3 float fields : x, y and z. A Vec3 can be used as parameter in a function that requires a Vec2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shape :
          <ul>
            <li>Vec2 position</li>
            <li>subs : 
              <ul>
                <li>Square :
                <ul>
                  <li>Vec2 size</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Circle :
                <ul>
                  <li>Float radius</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Square and circles have both a field position, and any square or circle can be used wherever a Shape is required. 
          </p>
        </p>
        Structural inheritance can be used in type match expression, enabling easy dispatch of data or message.
      </p>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      A program is divided in multiple sections:
      <ul>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Structs</li>
        <li>Nodes</li>
        <li>Actions</li>
        <li>Events</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        This section declare new functions. Functions are special classes, in the sense that they are the only classes can break the non-cyclic constraint.
        A function takes 1 or more parameters as input, and has one output parameter. A function can be generic, i.e. parameterized by types.
      </div>
      <h3>Structs</h3>
      See above
      <h3>Nodes</h3>
      They are the data of the program. A node is prefixed by a <code>def</code> or <code>var</code> declaration. The difference is very important.
      <p>
        A <code>def</code> node is a function, it will update its value according to its input values. This value cannot be change by mean of actions. 
        No mutator message can be sent to <code>def</code> nodes. No update method can be applied on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <code>var</code> node is a variable, a storage whose initial value is computed at the program initialisation. Afterward, its value can be changed by actions.
        Its value won't be automatically updated.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <p>
          An action is defined by a slot type (which can be Unit), and a list of slots, its sub-actions.
          When receiving a message, it will send sequentially messages to some or all of its slots. It can also send messages to itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>
          Like actions, an event has a list of sub-actions, but doesn't have an explicit slot. Instead it observes one or more properties and receives message
          when their value change. It is a reaction to property changes, and are the base of the reactive part of the language.
        </p>
      </div>
